# Learning Rust

This is a repo dedicated to the small apps / exploratory code as I work through [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 

I am currently using the experimental interactive [version here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) and have really enjoyed the process. Something about compiled languages is satisfying to me? I've also really enjoyed the error handling, and the general feel of writing Rust code.
